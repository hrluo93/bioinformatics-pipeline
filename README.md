infer Nc SNP Heterozygous rate by Maximum Likelihood Estimate(MLE).py
Need to input sequenced individuals mean of Heterozygous rate, standard deviation of Heterozygous rate and census pop size(Nc)
the infered snp Heterozygous distribution set as Normal distribution x = μ + σ * np.random.randn(nc)
result:(Nc's mean of Heterozygous rate, Nc's standard deviation of Heterozygous rate)
